    "description": "The skill provides the functionality to playback any audio or video requested by the user. AVmusic implements full integration of youtube_dl services and supports requests including but not limited to: - Music bands - Albums - Playlists - Specific songs - Radio - News clips - Tutorials - Mixes - Publicly available episodes of TV shows - Publicly available movies - Short clips AVmusic supports audio commands to stop, pause, and resume the playback of the currently playing video. If you requested a playlist, [you will see a list of available titles](#picture) on the left side of your opened video-player window. As of now, you can only have one instance (window) of MPV open at a time. If you invoke another playback request while watching something else, your current window will be closed and the new one will popup in its place. If you are typing your command in the terminal instead of audibly speaking it, don\u2019t worry about the typos or spelling - AVmusic will correct it for you.",
